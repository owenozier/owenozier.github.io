## Haiku by Sara Sadri ‘23
<i>Selection Bias: Studying a Lot and Getting a Bad Grade Doesn't Mean that Studying is Correlated with Lower Grades.</i>

Those who study more <br/>
might be self-selecting to, <br/>
because they know less. <br/>


## Poem by Emery Zahner ‘22
<i>A Ballad to the Multiple Regression Model</i>

As if a single variable were not enough <br/>
Multiple regression came along to add more stuff <br/>
When used for causal inference <br/>
There is one big difference. <br/>

MRM hold all other regressors constant <br/>
Alas that there not be any conflict <br/>
We still seek the change in Y <br/>
Only now we have a new ally <br/>

Betas still have a meaning <br/>
Though now their interpretations need intervening <br/>
Independent variables are the best <br/>
Cambridge Econometrics operates in Budapest <br/>

The interpretation of the intercept is largely the same <br/>
Linear regressions are siblings with a like aim <br/>
It simply shows where the population line starts on the Y axis <br/>
So there is no need to enter anaphylaxis <br/>

X two, X three, X four and more, <br/>
Multiple Linear Regression is nothing to abhor! <br/>

## Poem/adaptation by Tharini Prakash ‘23
<i>The Non-linear Model Not Taken</i>

Two models seemed to diverge in a problem set <br/>
And sorry I could not use both <br/>
And be one economist, I did not fret <br/>
Because when I predict values with the coefficients I get, <br/>
The logit and probit models show similar growth <br/>

Logit and Probit equally lay <br/>
In normal or logistic CDFs from zero to one <br/>
And while heavier the logit tail may weigh <br/>
I know neither model will lead me astray <br/>
So long as the data are non-linear, a reasonable prediction will be done <br/>

I shall be telling this without hesitation <br/>
Somewhere, after econometrics is done and I’ve done my due diligence: <br/>
Two models seemed to diverge in a problem set, <br/>
I took the probit model for its easier interpretation <br/>
And it has not made much difference <br/>
