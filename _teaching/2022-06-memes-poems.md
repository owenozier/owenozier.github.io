## Haiku by Lily Levin ‘23
<i>Difference-in-Difference</i>

We should embrace change. <br/>
Your growth diverges from B's; <br/>
that's why you're unique. <br/>

econometrics, <br/>
stats, and the real world, <br/>
plus stata breaking <br/>

## Anonymous 255 Student poem
<i>Metrics and Meter</i>

After time spent researching and time spent pondering, <br/>
Our dataset stood clean, free of any error, <br/>
A testament to our intellectual wandering, <br/>
A beacon against ignorance, that statistical terror. <br/>
Through Stata, we learned and began our procession, <br/>
The strength to topple untrue fact, <br/>
Our tool, the linear regression, <br/>
And a commitment to truth as our pact. <br/>
