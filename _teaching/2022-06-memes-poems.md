## Poem by Zola Baird '23

<i>An Ode to the OLS Regression</i>

An Ordinary Least Squares Estimator <br/>
Cuts through the noise to estimate the population data <br/>
It does this using its two friends Beta hat <br/>
These sample counterparts act as stand ins for the true population coefficients <br/>
And if they are useful, they will produce an R squared that is more than sufficient! <br/>

## Haiku by Lily Levin ‘23
<i>Difference-in-Difference</i>

We should embrace change. <br/>
Your growth diverges from B's; <br/>
that's why you're unique. <br/>

## Anonymous 255 Student poem
<i>Metrics and Meter</i>

After time spent researching and time spent pondering, <br/>
Our dataset stood clean, free of any error, <br/>
A testament to our intellectual wandering, <br/>
A beacon against ignorance, that statistical terror. <br/>
Through Stata, we learned and began our procession, <br/>
The strength to topple untrue fact, <br/>
Our tool, the linear regression, <br/>
And a commitment to truth as our pact. <br/>
