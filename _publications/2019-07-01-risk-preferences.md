## Abstract
We estimate the impact of Kenya's post-election violence on individual risk preferences.
Because the crisis interrupted a longitudinal survey of more than five thousand Kenyan youth,
this timing creates plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to civil conflict by the time of the survey.
We measure individual risk preferences using hypothetical lottery choice questions which we validate by
showing that they predict migration and entrepreneurship in the cross-section. Our results indicate that
the post-election violence sharply increased individual risk aversion. Findings remain robust when we use
an IV estimation strategy that exploits random assignment of respondents to waves of surveying.
