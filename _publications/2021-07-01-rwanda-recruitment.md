## Abstract
This paper reports on a two-tiered experiment designed to separately identify
the selection and effort margins of pay-for-performance (P4P).
At the recruitment stage, teacher labor markets were randomly assigned to
a 'pay-for-percentile' or fixed-wage contract. Once recruits were placed,
an unexpected, incentive-compatible, school-level re-randomization was
performed, so that some teachers who applied for a fixed-wage contract
ended up being paid by P4P, and vice versa. By the second year of the
study, the within-year effort effect of P4P was 0.16 standard deviations
of pupil learning, with the total effect rising to 0.20 standard deviations
after allowing for selection.
