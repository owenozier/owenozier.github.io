## Abstract
Bureaucratic performance is a crucial determinant of economic growth,
but little real-world evidence exists on how to improve it,
especially in resource-constrained settings.
We conducted a field experiment of a social recognition intervention to improve record keeping in health facilities in two Nigerian states,
replicating the intervention – implemented by a single organization – on bureaucrats performing identical tasks.
Social recognition improved performance in one state but had no effect in the other,
highlighting both the potential benefits and also the sometimes-limited generalizability of behavioral interventions.
Furthermore, differences in facility-level observables did not explain cross-state differences in impacts,
suggesting that it may often be difficult to predict external validity.
